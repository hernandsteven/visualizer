# Visualizer for searching algorithims
A little project I used to help me learn React and further my understanding of searching algorithms.

Currently, Depth First Search and Breadth First Search are available. Planning to add more algorithims in the future.

### How to use: 
You can place walls by clicking and dragging on the cells.
Run any algorithim available
You have the option to clear walls with a click of a button
You also have the option to reset the grid with a click of a button
